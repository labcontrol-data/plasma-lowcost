About
============

This page provides information about the project developed at Mesbah lab, UC Berkeley, USA, called ["Low-cost sensors and electronics for plasma reactors."](http://www.anvargas.com/blog/plasma.html)  Experiments were carried out in practice in a laboratory, and the data contained in this GitHub repository were collected in those experiments.

**Please check more details about this project in the page detailing the ["Deadbeat condition for the control design of RLC Oscillator."](http://www.anvargas.com/blog/rlcoscillator.html)**


`mainCodeMatlab.m` is a MATLAB(R) script that calls Matlab and generates simulation data. The script also generates figures. The figures contain both simulation and real-time data collected in a laboratory testbed.

`mainCodeArduinoDue.ino` is an Arduino Due code. This code process data that were collected in real time. The data contains information from low-cost probes that measured high-voltage from a plasma reactor. In addition, measurements from current and from a light sensor were taken and processed in an Arduino Due. All code and schematics and data are available in this repository.

For more details about the experimental data, as long as the corresponding academic publications, please visit [the project page](http://www.anvargas.com/blog).


Installation
============

1. Extract the ZIP file (or clone the git repository) in your computer.
2. Add the folders `code/` and `data/` to your path in MATLAB/Octave: e.g. 
    - using the "Set Path" dialog in MATLAB, or 
    - by running the `addpath` function from your command window or `startup` script.

Make sure that you are running Matlab 2017a (or a newer version). Older versions may work, but it is uncertain.
3. Upload the code `mainCodeArduinoDue.ino`in your Arduino Due using the corresponding IDE interface.

Usage
=====

Typical usage of `mainCodeMatlab.m` consists of running it in your MATLAB. The code generates figures.

MATLAB
------
  1. Run `mainCodeMatlab.m`.
